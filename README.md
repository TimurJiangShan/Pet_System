PetGo is a social networking site for contemporary pet owners. The website can not only
provide communication problems between pet owners and pet lovers, but also enable pet
shops to display the content and particularities of their stores on the website, so that pet
owners can have a more professional platform to solve problems with pets. Related issues.
Each user can post a description of the problem or show a pet, and other users can comment
or answer the post. In this way, users can communicate well through the platform, and users
can get to know each other. Pet shops can display their shop pairs on the map provided by the
platform. When choosing a pet shop, users can be more targeted.
